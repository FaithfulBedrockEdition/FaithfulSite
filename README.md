## About
I was eager to start a new project and didn't know what to start on. After finding Google's [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), I had gotten an instant urge of inspiration. I immediately started working on MaterialCraft.

If you're not too familiar with HTML and CSS, you should probably either familiarize yourself, or hire someone to customize the template for you. The template has been made as easy to customize as possible, but there's only so much I can do.

##### Twitter Widget
